<h1 align="center">My Todo</h1>

My Todo is a simple and elegant Android app that helps you manage your tasks. You can create, edit, delete and restore todos with a few taps. The app uses modern technologies and best practices to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Features

- Jetpack Compose: The app is built entirely with Jetpack Compose, the new declarative UI toolkit for Android.
- Room Database: The app uses Room to store the todos in the local device. Room is an abstraction layer over SQLite that provides a convenient way to access and manipulate data.
- Clean Architecture: The app follows the principles of clean architecture, which separates the code into different layers of responsibility and abstraction. The app has three main layers: presentation, domain and data.
- MVVM: The app uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to communicate between the layers. MVVM allows the UI to be reactive and consistent with the data, while keeping the logic and state in the view model.
